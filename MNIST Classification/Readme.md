The assignment is classification of handwritten digits using MNIST dataset. 
The hyper parameters such as optimizer, number of layers, activation function were tuned to obtain the best accuracy. 
The best accuracy is obtained by adam optimizer using Relu activation function and 3 layers with a batch size of 32. The implementation for the same is in Best-Accuracy-MNIST_classification.ipynb.
